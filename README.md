# **JavaScript Journey**  

JavaScript is a vast and flexible language, offering multiple ways to accomplish the same task. Without a clear personal standard, it is easy to get lost in abstraction and inconsistent coding styles. **jsjourney** is a structured approach to mastering JavaScript by focusing on clarity, consistency, and fundamental programming principles.  

As part of this journey, a **personal JavaScript standard** has been established. This standard does not limit the use of JavaScript’s full capabilities but serves as a guiding principle to maintain a **strong, structured, and maintainable coding style**. It ensures that every piece of JavaScript code written remains readable and logically sound, even after long periods of working with other languages.  

This is not just about writing JavaScript, it’s about **building a programming mindset** that aligns with core algorithmic principles and foundational programming concepts. By following a structured approach, the transition between languages such as **C, Java, and PHP** becomes seamless, reinforcing a deeper understanding of programming logic rather than just syntax differences.  

The following standard is a core part of **jsjourney**, ensuring a **consistent and disciplined** approach to JavaScript development.

### **Personal Standardization of JavaScript for Consistency and Clarity**  

JavaScript offers multiple ways to achieve the same functionality, but without clear standardization, code can become inconsistent and difficult to maintain. This standard ensures order and discipline in writing JavaScript while keeping its core features intact. It is not a limitation but a guideline to build a strong and fundamental foundation in JavaScript.  

#### **Core Standards for Mastery:**  

1. **"use strict";** → Always enable strict mode to prevent hidden bugs and enforce a more disciplined coding approach.  
2. **Variable (`let`, `const`)** → Use only `let` and `const`, avoiding `var` to ensure safer and more predictable variable behavior.  
3. **Data Types (Especially Arrays)** → Mastering array usage and other fundamental data types commonly used in application development.  
4. **If-Else** → Use **if-else** as the primary control flow structure, avoiding reliance on `switch case` or the ternary operator for complex conditions.  
5. **For Loop** → **For loop** is the primary iteration method, avoiding unnecessary complexity from `while`, `do-while`, or higher-order functions like `map` and `forEach`.  
6. **Function Declaration** → Among all function types in JavaScript, **function declaration** (`function functionName() {}`) is the preferred standard due to its clarity, hoisting support, and better structure in complex codebases.  
7. **Error Handling (`try/catch`, `throw`)** → All errors should be handled using `try/catch` and `throw`, rather than relying solely on `.catch()` from Promises.  
8. **Async/Await** → **Async/Await** is the primary method for handling asynchronous operations to maintain readability and avoid excessive `.then().catch()` chaining.  
9. **Class & Object** → **Class and object** should be used for more complex data structures, avoiding direct prototype manipulation unless absolutely necessary.  
10. **Modules (`import/export`)** → **ES Modules** (`import/export`) are the standard for modularization, replacing CommonJS (`require()`) for consistency in modern JavaScript environments.  

Following these standards ensures that the code remains **consistent, readable, and maintainable** while still allowing flexibility when necessary.

### **Note: The Purpose of This Standard**  

This standard is created to maintain **consistency in JavaScript programming**. Rather than relying on excessive abstraction or overly complex paradigms, it focuses on **fundamental programming principles and core algorithmic thinking**. The goal is to establish a **clear and structured** approach to JavaScript without unnecessary complexity.  

This standard is **for personal use**, designed to ensure that JavaScript code remains comprehensible and logically sound, even after months of not working with the language. Since programming is not limited to JavaScript alone, having a structured guideline helps maintain **a strong foundation in other languages** like **C, Java, and PHP** without disrupting fundamental programming logic.  

By following this approach, the logic behind every JavaScript program remains intuitive and easy to understand, even after long periods of working with different languages. This ensures that coming back to JavaScript after a break does not require relearning complex or overly abstracted concepts but instead focuses on **core programming logic and fundamental structures** that are applicable across multiple languages.
